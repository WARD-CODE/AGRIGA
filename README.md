# AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION SYSTEM (USER INTERFACE)
This project presents a Desktop User Interface for a Agriculture purposes. Its main goal is to find the Irrigation parameters based on weather data calculated of a specific area, not only that but it is also connected to sensors and actuators to control the flow of water based on the Evapotranspiration schedule.
this system includes 5 units:
 - The weather data unit.
 - The irrigation mode selection.
 - the irrigation parameters identification.
 - the actuators model and sensors detections.
 - the Evapotranspiration Algorithm and scientific calculation.
